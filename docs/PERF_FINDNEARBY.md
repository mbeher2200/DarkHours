# find_nearby Performance

Current performance architecture of `darksky.find_nearby` (the `/nearby` async job),
plus the investigation log that produced it. Facts below verified against the code
and CDK on 2026-07-18; in-region timings are from the dated runs in Appendix A.

## Current state

End-to-end `/nearby` is **worker-bound**: the API side (enqueue + job polls) runs
warm at 2–15 ms, and the SQS worker does all the work. The optimizations that got
here, all shipped and still in effect:

- **Keep-warm on both Lambdas.** EventBridge pings the API and the worker every
  4 minutes (`cdk/lambda_api_stack.py`); a Record-less event makes the worker run
  its prewarm synchronously. Real jobs skip the ~4.6 s cold Init entirely.
- **Background prewarm** (`apps/worker/handler.py::_prewarm`, daemon thread on
  cold start): warms the raster grids, PAD-US + OSM POI indexes, the DynamoDB
  connection pool, and the ephemeris — so those costs are off the job path.
- **Columnar PAD-US index.** Sorted-uint64 `.npz` + `np.searchsorted`
  (`darksky._load_padus_h3_index`): ~450 ms cold load (down ~35× from the original
  dict build), 0 ms in-job thanks to prewarm. See `docs/PADUS_INDEX.md`.
- **Rasterio-free raster reads.** Window reads are tiled-grid S3 byte-range GETs,
  tiles fetched concurrently (`gridraster.py`; see `docs/RASTERIO_REPLACEMENT.md`).
  Typically ~200–400 ms per dataset in-region.
- **Vectorized dome detection.** The per-blob centroid loop was replaced with
  batched `bincount`/`center_of_mass(index=)` ops (~12–30× faster, ~80–200 ms), and
  the whole dome pipeline is skipped when the origin is Bortle ≥ 8 (no dome could
  ever qualify).
- **Reverse-geocode discipline.** 8-mile pre-dedup of candidate probes
  (`_NAME_DEDUP_MILES`), POI/PAD-US-index-first naming, and — on the aws backend
  only — parallel AWS Location calls (~87 ms each in-region) with a pooled client.
  The local backend stays serial per Nominatim's 1 req/s policy.
- **Drive times via `CalculateRoutes`, per-leg, in parallel.** One point-to-point
  call per cache-missing leg (bounded thread pool), replacing the batched
  `CalculateRouteMatrix` call whose undocumented 60 km `Avoid` cap silently killed
  whole searches (see the 2026-07-12 entry). Each leg is cached 24 h
  (`_DRIVE_CACHE_TTL`); repeat-area searches pay ~0 for this phase. Ferry /
  unpaved-tail warnings come from the route legs.
- **Memory:** both Lambdas run at 3008 MB (the account cap; a 2 GB→3 GB A/B showed
  init flat and only ~0.3 s invoke gain, but the bump shipped later with the
  worker's larger workload).

Representative warm-container, cache-warm total: **~1–3 s** per search, dominated
by first-visit drive-time legs and the two raster window reads (Appendix A,
2026-06-16 table — measured before the CalculateRoutes switch; first-visit
drive-time timing has not been re-profiled in-region since).

## Instrumentation (opt-in, kept)

- `PYNIGHTSKY_PROFILE=1` — per-phase wall time + cache hit/miss delta logged from
  `find_nearby` (`[profile]` lines; `darksky._Profiler`).
- `cache.stats` — hit/miss counter at the `cache.get` chokepoint (`cache.py`).
- `scripts/profile_aws.sh` + `scripts/aws_one_search.py` — one profiled search
  against the real aws backend (resource names from env; needs an authenticated
  session).
- The throwaway in-region test-worker recipe in `CLAUDE.md` for validating changes
  on real infra without touching the deployed worker.

## Provider latency reference (as measured 2026-06)

| Provider | Use | Observed latency |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Location (SearchPlaceIndexForPosition) | reverse geocode (aws) | ~87 ms/call in-region |
| Nominatim | reverse/forward geocode (local) | ~1.1 s/call (self-throttled; policy: 1 req/s, no parallel) |
| Overpass (`overpass-api.de`) | natural-area names (local) | ~7.6 s/query |
| Open-Meteo / 7Timer | weather | sub-second |
| Celestrak | TLEs | sub-second |

Live connectivity for every provider is covered by `tests/test_provider_smoke.py`
(`PYNIGHTSKY_LIVE=1 pytest -m live`).

## Open items

- **Re-profile drive times in-region** since the CalculateRouteMatrix →
  CalculateRoutes switch (N client-parallel calls, ≤11/search): the 2026-06-16
  phase timings predate it. Repeat-area searches are cache-served either way.
- **GeoRoutes cost parity** between matrix pairs and per-leg requests is likely
  but was never confirmed numerically (pricing figures sit behind AWS's
  JS-rendered calculator).
- AWS Location TPS quota (~50 req/s account default) should be raised before
  scaling parallel geocode wider; adaptive retries cushion bursts today.

## Reproduce

- `scripts/bench_padus_load.py` — PAD-US load + lookup benchmark (`--verify-against`).
- `scripts/profile_find_nearby.py` — per-phase profile across cities (warm + `--cold`).
- `scripts/diag_geocode_waste.py` — classify reverse-geocode probes (kept/duplicate/water).
- `scripts/profile_parallel_geocode.py` — offline serial-vs-parallel A/B (stubbed latency).
- `scripts/bench_dome_detection.py` — dome-detection benchmark on real windows.
- `scripts/profile_aws.sh` + `scripts/aws_one_search.py` — real-backend profiled search.

## Appendix A — investigation log (2026-06-09 → 2026-07-12)

One variable at a time; before/after numbers preserved.

### 2026-06-09 — baseline & root causes

`find_nearby` was network-bound on cold searches: ~85–95% of wall time was reverse
geocoding + an Overpass call that always timed out.

Local backend, radius 60 mi, city-centre origins:

| Origin | Wall | cache hit-rate | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Los Angeles | 28.9 s | 0% | cold |
| New York | 26.4 s | 9% | |
| Chicago | 27.5 s | 8% | |
| Denver | 1.3 s | 50% | Overpass result cached |
| Phoenix | 62.0 s | 2% | 42 geocode misses |
| Atlanta | 36.0 s | 5% | |
| LA (repeat, warm) | 1.3 s | 92% | everything cached |

LA cold breakdown (28.9 s): `overpass join` 15007 ms (timeout every call),
`jit geocode candidates` 9421 ms (9 Nominatim misses × ~1.1 s), `padus index load`
2306 ms (one-time), `light dome detection` 937 ms, raster reads ~280 ms.

Root causes: (1) dead Overpass endpoint `overpass.private.coffee` — guaranteed 15 s
join timeout and zero natural-area names; only `overpass-api.de` responded
(~7.6 s). (2) Duplicate-dominated reverse geocoding — on Phoenix, 36 of 43 probes
returned duplicate town names (median 5.3 mi apart).

**Tier-0 fixes shipped:** Overpass URL reverted to `overpass-api.de` (local
backend only); 8-mi geocode pre-dedup (Phoenix cold probes 43 → 25); parallel
reverse-geocode on the aws backend; pooled boto3 `location` client.

**In-region validation** (throwaway `proftest` worker, x86_64/2 GB): AWS Location
≈ 87 ms/call; parallel geocode ≈ 4× (`jit geocode candidates` 1746 → 339 ms).
New dominant cold cost: `padus index load` = 5–24 s per cold container.

### 2026-06-09 — PAD-US index: dict build → columnar uint64 + binary search

Replaced the ~1.37M-entry string-keyed dict build with a sorted `uint64` cell
array + parallel name/blacklist arrays via `np.searchsorted`.

| Metric | Before (dict) | After (columnar) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Index load, median (laptop) | 1787.7 ms | 53.7 ms (~33×) |
| Lookup | 0.85 µs/pt | 2.54 µs/pt (≈0.3 ms/search — negligible) |
| Index size | 10.6 MB | 3.5 MB |
| Correctness | — | 0 mismatches over 50,006 checks |

In-region steady cold-container load ≈ 450 ms (down from 15–24 s, ~35×). The
first-ever container after an image deploy paid a one-time ~17 s image lazy-load
tax — a container-era artifact that disappeared when the worker became a zip
Lambda (see `docs/RASTERIO_REPLACEMENT.md`).

### 2026-06-09 — vectorized dome detection + naming parallelism + B8–9 suppression

97–98% of `_find_light_domes_from_array` was the per-blob centroid loop
(O(blobs × pixels)). Replaced with batched `np.bincount` + scipy
`center_of_mass`/`maximum` with `index=` — output-identical.

| Origin (≈1.3M-px window) | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Los Angeles (315 domes) | 928 ms | 79 ms |
| New York (829 domes) | 2547 ms | 84 ms |
| Phoenix (in-region) | ~1726 ms | 207 ms |
| Dallas (in-region) | ~4516 ms | 185 ms |

Dome **naming** parallelised on aws (~7×: 1451 → 214 ms on Sedona), and the whole
dome pipeline gated on `origin_bortle <= 7` (a dome must be ≥ origin+2 and the
brightest blob is B9, so B8–9 origins can never qualify — was pure waste).

### 2026-06-10 — non-blocking prewarm + memory A/B

The worker ran `_prewarm_rasters()` synchronously at module init, blowing Lambda's
10 s init budget (`INIT_REPORT … Status: timeout`). Moved to a daemon thread and
extended to rasters + PAD-US + DynamoDB pool + ephemeris. Init 10 s-timeout →
~4.4–5.8 s; PAD-US in-job → 0 ms; first cold-job TOTAL ~3.1–3.5 s.

Memory A/B (2 GB vs 3008 MB): init flat, invoke −0.3 s, +47% GB-s → decision at
the time was to stay at 2 GB. (Both Lambdas later moved to 3008 MB as their
workload grew; that is the deployed config today.)

### 2026-06-11 — rasterio → tiled-grid lookup latency A/B

40 identical random points, host → S3 over WAN (relative numbers are the signal):

| | cold open | warm sample (median / p90 / max / mean) |
|---|---|---|
| OLD rasterio `/vsis3` COG | 368 ms | 154 / 292 / 562 / 164 ms |
| NEW gridraster S3 (host) | ~310 ms | 181 / 277 / 360 / 195 ms |
| NEW in throwaway container | 313 ms | 198 / 333 / 589 / 224 ms |

Verdict: no meaningful lookup slowdown — single-pixel reads are S3-RTT-bound, and
the new path reads 4 bytes instead of a whole COG tile with a better tail.
Correctness: all 10 test cities identical SQM/Bortle/source across old/new/local.

### 2026-06-16 — lifecycle profile, worker keep-warm, drive-time caching

In-region warm profile (throwaway worker cloned from the deployed artifact,
per-phase ms):

| phase | cold+cachecold | warm+cachecold | warm+cachewarm |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| drive times (aws, uncached) | 1961 | 934 | 1978 |
| viirs window read (S3) | 562 | 928 | 347 |
| falchi window read (S3) | 378 | 371 | 200 |
| extract+cluster+dome-detect (CPU) | 656 | 558 | 543 |
| jit geocode | 82 | 826 | 5 |
| dome naming | 459 | 323 | 62 |
| origin settlement+lookup | 1385 | 377 | 9 |
| **TOTAL handler** | **5499** (+Init 4454) | **4340** | **3158** |

Headline: even fully cache-warm, drive times ≈ 63% of the job. Shipped: the
worker keep-warm EventBridge rule (rate 4 min, synchronous prewarm on warmup
events; verified cold ping Init 4.93 s + 1.56 s prewarm off the user path) and the
per-leg drive-time cache (`route_drive|…` keys) so only cache-missing legs hit
the routing API.

### 2026-07-12 — CalculateRouteMatrix → CalculateRoutes (ferry/dirt-road detection)

The "warn on ferry-bridged / unpaved routes" feature (#107) didn't work in prod.
Two confirmed problems with `CalculateRouteMatrix`, verified with live calls
against the exact Juneau, AK coordinates from the bug report:

1. `RouteMatrixEntry` carries only `{Distance, Duration, Error}` — no `Notices`,
   no `Legs` — so a ferry/dirt-road violation can't be read off it structurally.
2. **The primary cause:** passing `Avoid` with `TravelMode=Car` imposes an
   undocumented **60 km cap** per origin–destination pair; exceeding it raises
   `ValidationException` for the *entire batched request*. At this app's 60/120 mi
   radii that's routine, so every candidate's drive time in the search silently
   failed (blanket `except Exception` + the frontend's ≥1-successful-leg gate) —
   every place fell back to a plain unlabeled Maps link, exactly the prod symptom.

Fix (PR #108): `_aws_drive_times` calls `CalculateRoutes` once per missing leg,
client-parallel (bounded pool, ≤11 legs/search). No 60 km cap (confirmed live: a
77.8 km Juneau leg with the same `Avoid` succeeds and returns the `Ferry`-typed
leg). Ferry detection uses the structural `Legs[].Type == "Ferry"` signal. The
24 h per-leg cache is unchanged. Cost parity with the matrix API is likely
(both bill per route) but unconfirmed numerically; in-region latency for
first-visit searches not yet re-profiled.

## Appendix B — raw data

`docs/perf_runs/findnearby_funnel_2026-06-09.jsonl` — the 5-city AWS in-region
funnel/profile run (per-phase wall times, candidate-funnel counts, surfaced
coordinates) captured with the funnel logging + `PYNIGHTSKY_NO_CACHE=1` on a warm
2 GB worker. Steady-state per-phase medians from that run: raster window reads
~110–410 ms each, extract ~220–300 ms, dome detection ~180–210 ms, drive times
~180–780 ms, TOTAL 1.5–4.7 s across San Diego / Sedona / Knolls / Roswell /
Atlantic City.
